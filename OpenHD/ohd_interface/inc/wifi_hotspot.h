 /**
  * Wifi hotspot refers to creating a WiFi Access point on the device we are
  * running on. External clients like QOpenHD running on a tablet can then
  * connect to the hotspot. Note that auto video and telemetry forwarding is not
  * implemented for WiFi hotspot - On the one hand, this is prone to errors
  * anyways, on the other hand, it is hard to do to actively search for connected
  * devices and their IPs. TCP mavlink (perhaps also video in the future) is the
  * way to go here. Change Nov4 2022: Uses network manager - we already have
  * network manager installed and enabled by default on the rpi on the openhd
  * images, but the default raspbian images from pi foundation have it only
  * installed, but disabled by default (they'l use it eventually)
